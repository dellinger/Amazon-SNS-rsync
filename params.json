Uses Amazon SNS to notify on status.","body":"### Rsync backup scripts\r\nThe purpose of these scripts is to run a daily / weekly backup.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Amazon Simple Notification Service](http://aws.amazon.com/sns/) is used to abstract notifications from the script. \r\n\r\n\r\nAmazon SNS uses the notion of \"Topics\" which can be defined in the Amazon Management Console (or through the command line interface). The Topic I'll be using is \"rsync-daily\" and \"rsync-weekly\".\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, the script will send a message depending on the rsync completion status to the topic. I can subscribe my phone number or email address to get a text message or email address depending on what I would like.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe settings I currently have set is,\r\n\r\n\r\n**rsync-daily** = Only send me a text message on ANY FAILURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n**rsync-weekly** = Send me a detailed email on ANY completion status. If SUCCESS then send me a capacity of my source and a capacity of my destination. If FAILURE, send me the failure exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n___\r\nIf you have any issues with this, send me an email @dellinger\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
